# ORSProject

So this is my ORS321 Project that doesn't do half the stuff it's supposed to. From the before timedfd s.
It does, however, do everything that the ORS221 and ORS122 are supposed to do.

You can look at this project for ideas (although I don't reccomend it, it's not very good).
However, I absolutely do not give you permission to use this as your own project if you have something similiar.dd

(You would get sucky marks anyway, just like I did)
